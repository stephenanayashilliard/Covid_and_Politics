# Outline of Project 
This project will examine county-specific data across all 50 states in the US. These data have been extracted from various sources and include demographic information on age, race, gender, and votes from the 2020 presidental election, as well as COVID-19 infection rates. While these data are extensive, it is important to note that the data was collected at a specific point in time, and therefore, does not account for changes that may have occurred. 

Overall, this project aims to answer if there are correlations between infection rates of COVID-19 and a county's voting behavior or demographics, specifically, age, gender or economic status. 

# Initial Analysis 
This section of the project explores the data through Tableau, which will provide some framework for further statistical analysis. 

**Total Cases by State**

The above graph shows the total number of cases per state. While this image gives some information on the number of cases reported within each state, further analysis could provide insight into how the number of cases fits within the total population. This comparison of states does not consider population size. An additional comparison of population per square mile would also be interesting to examine. 

**Cases vs. Voting Count/Percentage**
