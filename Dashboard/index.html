                    <h2>About Our Project</h2>
                    <p>Using data acquired from multiple sources, we set out to discover if there are correlations 
                    with Covid 19 rates of infection and a countie's political views,  the race makeup or ethnicity, age, gender or economic status of it's population. </p>

                <!--Database-->
                <div class= "tabcontent" id="Database">
                    <h2>Database</h2>
                    <p>To allow for the greatest possible diversity, or data was drawn from over 3000 counties in the
                        United States.  Our data was obtained from the United States Census Bureau, the Association of Statisticians
                        of American Religious Bodies (ASARB) as well as Covid 19 rates of infection and death rates from Kaggle. </p>
                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <h4>Part One</h4>
                    <p>From the intitial research, four csv files containing a total of 53 data points for 3049 counties was retrieved. Using Pandas, 
                        the four csv files were converted to dataframes then organized, data was converted to usuable numbers where needed and null values were 
                        converted to zeros.</p>
                    <h4>Part Two</h4>
                    <p>Creating the Join Key: To perform a join, there needs to be a field to join on. A common field native to the data was available so one 
                        was created. A column was created to hold the key and then set the value equal to the result of county and state column data combined in each row. 
                        County data was then used as the primary table because it had the most results.</p>
                    <p>Joining in Parts: To execute the join, the two tables were joined into an interim table, table_one, and then a third table was joined, creating a table_two. 
                        This process was repeated again to join the fourth table into the final database.</p>
                    <p>Troubleshooting Issues: The fields that were null after the joins from part two needed to be filled in in order to not obstruct the upcoming machine learning model. 
                        The null values were converted into zeros and the result saved.</p>
                    
                </div> 

                <!--Machine Learning-->
                <div class= "tabcontent" id="Machine Learning">
                    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
                    <p>The goal of the machine learning aspect of this project is to predict if a county’s voting patterns in the 2020 election are correlated to covid 
                        transmission. Specifically, looking at the percentage of votes for Donald Trump and the percentage of votes for Joe Biden and the number of covid 
                        cases per county were used to make predictions. </p>
                    <h3>Models Used</h3>
                    <p>An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Model was used to analyze one independent variable at a time and its relation to the dependent variable- covid cases. 
                        A Random Forest Regressor (RFR) model was used to analyze multiple independent variables in relation to the dependent variable- covid cases. 
                        The OLS model was chosen for its ability to produce descriptive summary statistics and for its ability to be graphed using statsmodels packages. 
                        The RFR model was used for its ability to rank feature importances and for its compatibility with other sklearn packages such as RobustScaler, 
                        Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Train, Test, Split.</p>
                    <h3>Scaling and Data Preprocessing</h3>
                    <p>For the OLS model, a new column was created titled “normalized_cases” which was created by dividing the number of covid cases per county by the population
                         of that county. This created a more usable variable because it more closely resembled the format of the percentage of votes for Trump and Biden columns. 
                         Because both of these columns contained numbers between 0 and 1, it behaved better in the OLS model.</p>
                    <p>For the RFR model, the Robust Scaler was used because of its ability to handle outliers by using the interquartile range to scale the data. 
                        The “normalized_cases” column was not used in the RFR model to preserve the original data format for the correlation matrix and for the ranking of 
                        feature importance. For both models, the data was preprocessed by another team member to include religion and age metrics by county from other datasets. 
                        This was helpful for the correlation matrix and for the ranking of feature importance.</p>
                    <h3>Targets and Features</h3>
                    <p>For both models, the target was covid cases. The only difference is that the OLS model used the “normalized_cases” calculation and the RFR model used the 
                        raw covid cases per county data. The features for the OLS model were the percentage of votes for Donald Trump per county, percentage of votes for Joe 
                        Biden per county, and the total votes per county columns.</p>
                    <p>For the RFR model, the feature columns were divided into three categories: economic data, ethnicity data, and political data. PCA was used to reduce the 
                        dimensions of the grouped datasets to two dimensions before training, testing, and splitting the data for the model. Using PCA for the multivariate RFR 
                        model made graphing the findings easier and was useful for grouping multiple columns into two components based on the distribution and variance of the data.</p>
                    <h3>Limitations</h3>
                    <p>The main limitation of the machine learning portion of this project is from the dataset. Because the dataset is based on a single moment in time, 
                        the linear model can not extrapolate the predictions into the future. If the dataset was organized in a time-series format that tracked the amount 
                        of covid cases over time, then this model could predict the amount of covid cases based on the time-series data.</p>

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>It was determined from the onset of the project that the dashboard for the project needed to be fully interactive and contain both information about 
                        processes for the individual deliverables, as well as a written report about the analysis. For illustrative purposes, the dashboard allows the user to 
                        choose a county from a drop down menu. From that choice illustrated graphs are created and depicted. </p>

                    <h2>Politics vs Cases/Deaths</h2>
                    <p>This analysis is based on the OLS regression model described earlier in the readme under the "Machine Learning" section. 
                        The three factors used and their relation to covid were a county's percentage of votes for Trump in the 2020 election, 
                        a county's percentage of votes for Biden in the 2020 election, and a county's total votes in the 2020 election.</p>
                    <h3>Percentage of Trump Votes and Covid Cases (Per County)</h3>
                    <p>The chart below shows the OLS summary statistcs for this analysis. Notably, the R-squared is 68% and the p-value is 0. 
                        This means that 68% of the covid cases are explained by a county's votes for Donald Trump, and that we can reject the null hypothesis that 
                        this relationship is due to random chance.</p>

                    <h3>Percentage of Biden Votes and Covid Cases (Per County)</h3>
                    <p>The chart below shows the OLS summary statistcs for this analysis. Notably, the R-squared is 60% and the p-value is 0. 
                        This means that 60% of the covid cases are explained by a county's votes for Joe Biden, and that we can reject the null 
                        hypothesis that this relationship is due to random chance.</p>

                    <p>The chart below shows the OLS summary statistcs for this analysis. Notably, the R-squared is 65% and the p-value is 0. This means that 65% of the covid cases are explained by a county's total votes,
                     and that we can reject the null hypothesis that this relationship is due to random chance.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <h3>OLS Real Values vs Predictions and Mean Difference</h3>
                    <p>Another method for analyzing the regression results apart from the summary statistics is to compare the real values and the predicted values. 
                        This was done by creating a dataframe with the real values, predicted values, and the the difference between these values 
                        (by subtracting the real values from the predicted values). Next, the mean of these differences was calculated for each model and put 
                        into the dataframe below:</p>
                    <img src = "https://github.com/stephenanayashilliard/Covid_and_Politics/blob/main/images/ml_images/ml_comparison.png?raw=true" 
                    width='auto'  height ='auto' alt='ml comparison'>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>From this dataframe, we can conclude that the OLS model was able to best predict the amount of covid cases based on a county's percentage of
                         votes for Donald Trump. However, there does appear to be a relationship between the R-squared value and the mean of the differences 
                         for each model's independent variable: the higher the R-squared, the lower the mean of differences is between the real values and 
                         the predicted values for each model's independent variable. From this, we can conclude that the ability of a linear regression model 
                         to explain the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable directly affects the ability of that model to make predictions.</p>
                    <h3>RFR Model Insights</h3>
                    <p>Below is a correlation matrix graph that indicates the correlation between all features in the dataset. This was useful in helping 
                        to determine the levels of correlation between features, 
                        most importantly between covid cases per county and everything else.</p>

                        <br><br>    
                    <h3>RFR Ranking of Feature Importance</h3>
                    <p>One of the main benefits of the RFR model is its ability to rank the importance of features based on the target of covid cases per county. 
                        The graph below ranks the top 11 most important features used in the RFR model. This provides further insight into what characteristics have
                         the greatest effect on covid cases per county.</p>
                     <img src = "https://github.com/stephenanayashilliard/Covid_and_Politics/blob/main/images/ml_images/feature_importances.png?raw=true" 
                         width='auto'  height ='auto' alt='features'>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Analysis of Results</h3>
                    <p>Based on the above above information, there are several conclusions that can be made. First, the R-squared values are all within 60% to 68%, 
                        which tells us that this model only explains the relationship between covid cases and voting behavior to a certain extent. 
                        The p-values of 0 are a strong indicator that the relationship of this data is not due to random chance, and
                         that there is a statistically significant relationship between voting behavior and covid cases.</p>
                    <p>The RFR model's ranking of feature importance and the correlation matrix both demonstrate that for voting behaviors, 
                        votes for Donald Trump seem to be most correlated to covid cases per county. This is confirmed by the OLS model's R-squared and 
                        difference of means of predictions vs. real values for the percentage of votes for Donald Trump.</p>

                    <p>Density plots for each racial category illustrate that populations are not normally distributed across the selected counties. Further, 
                        that racial groups are not equally represented within each county and within the entire dataset. For Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native, 
                        and Pacific populations, the data is right skewed. In contrast, white populations are left skewed. This shows that there is more data on 
                        counties with larger white populations. </p>
                    <h3>Shapiro Tests</h3>>
                    <img src = "https://github.com/stephenanayashilliard/Covid_and_Politics/blob/main/images/race_analysis/shapiro_tests.png?raw=true" 
                    width='auto'  height ='auto' alt='Shapiro'>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Shapiro tests for each racial category continue to support, in addition to visual assessments of the density plots, that the data is skewed. 
                        Because the calculated p-values are less than a significance level of 0.05, there is quantitative data to substainate that the data is not 
                        normally distributed.</p>
                    <h3>T-Tests</h3>
                    <img src = "https://github.com/stephenanayashilliard/Covid_and_Politics/blob/main/images/race_analysis/t-test_countyvscountry.png?raw=true" 
                    width='auto'  height ='auto' alt='t_test'>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>One-sample t-tests were conducted to compare if the distributions of race across sample counties were representative of national demographics. 
                        The national demographics were taken from the US Census from 2020 (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI725219#RHI725219). 
                        While it could be assumed that the categories by the US Census align with the census county data, it should be noted that the methodologies of reporting race vary. 
                        It may be possible that people may have been recorded differently between the two points of data collection, and therefore, this comparison may not be accurate. 
                        Specifically, the US Census included categories "Two or more races", "White alone, not Hispanic or Latino", while the other dataset does not include those categories.  </p>
                    <p>With the assumption that the categories are, in fact, aligned, all p-values for each racial category from the one-sample t-tests are calculated under 
                        the 0.05 significance level. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. There is a statistical difference between the 
                        means of each racial category and its national percentage, showing that racial representation differ at the county level.</p>
                    <h3>Correlations Between Race and Covid Cases and Deaths</h3>
                    <p>Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for each racial category against the number of COVID cases and deaths. Subsets of the data were filtered 
                        to remove counties that reported 0% populations of specific ethinicities. Calculating correlation coefficients with these subsets showed that correlations 
                        were generally weaker (albeit not by much) when counties that did not report citizens of specific racial categories were removed. It should be noted that 
                        there were no counties that reported 0% white.</p>
                    <img src = "https://github.com/stephenanayashilliard/Covid_and_Politics/blob/main/images/race_analysis/pearsoncoefficients_deaths.png?raw=true" 
                    width='auto'  height ='auto' alt='pearson death'>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Racial categories against the number of deaths show relatively weak correlations than expected. Asian populations and number of deaths show the strongest correlation
                         at 0.3866916 and 0.3816597 when populations with 0% Asian American citizens were removed.</p>

                    width='auto'  height ='auto' alt='pearson case'>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Racial categories against the number of COVID related deaths performed similarly for Pearson correlation coefficients.</p>
                    <p>These coefficients for both the number of cases and deaths offer opposing ideas to other studies and reports. Specifically, from this data, the coefficient shows a negative correlation 
                        between COVID cases and Native populations. In contrast, the CDC has reported that cases in American Indian/Native Americans are 3.5 times that of non-Hispanic whites 
                        (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0819-covid-19-impact-american-indian-alaska-native.html). Additionally, there are several reports that minority communities have
                         been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, however, these correlation coefficients do not substantiate those claims. </p>

                    <h2>Economics vs Cases/Deaths</h2>
                    <p>This component of the overall analysis examines the relevance of the economic demographic variables to the strength of the overall 
                        Covid19 cases and deaths predicting model that we have endeavor to build here. While this analysis confirms the relevance of economic 
                        demographic variables with linear regression models, it leaves quantifying that relevance to the broader analysis in the machine learning section. 
                        To substantiate the relevance of the aforementioned variables, see the below for the p-values of the multi-variable linear regressions below with 
                        income, poverty rate, and unemployment rate as independent variables and Covid19 deaths and cases as dependent variables.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p>Here, the p-values establish the statistical significance of each variable. However, the R-squared values of both linear regressions can be
                         interpreted as saying that these variables are very limited in their ability to alone predict Covid cases and deaths. Which brings us to a 
                         point where we should explore each of these variables.</p>
                    <h3>Income</h3>
                    <p>The average incomes per county represented in the databased are distributed around approximately $49k.</p>
                    <h3>Poverty Rates</h3>
                    <p>The poverty rates in the database are predominantly distributed around 15% per county.</p>
